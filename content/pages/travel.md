# Address

The conference takes place at [Native
Space](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5650394474), Schlesische Straße 30,
10997 Berlin.

# Public Transport

The [public transport](https://www.bvg.de/en) stops closest to Native Space are

* Bus stop Taborstraße (2min walk)
* U Schlesisches Tor (7min walk)
* S Warschauer Straße (12min walk)

If you have an Android Phone, the
[Transportr](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.grobox.liberario) app works
very well with the public transport API of Berlin.

# Airplane

Berlin's two major airports Schönefeld
([SXF](https://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-sxf/index.php)) and Tegel
([TXL](https://www.berlin-airport.de/en/travellers-txl/index.php)) are fairly
well connected with public transport. However, Schönefeld airport might be
faster to get to/ travel from.

# Train

If you're coming in by train (with [Deutsche
Bahn](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml)), you can either go to Berlin
Hauptbahnhof (Main Station), or Berlin Ostbahnhof (East Station).

While the latter is closer to the location, both are connect to public
transport by S-Bahn (local train) and bus.
